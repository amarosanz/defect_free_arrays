# defect_free_arrays
Optical traps usually present a ~50% probability of single-atom trapping per site, meaning that the probability of filling an array of _N_ atoms scales as 0.5^{N}. For relatively large _N_, our atomic array is very likely to contain **vacancies**. 
The challenge here is to fill those vacancies in an efficient way to rapidly achieve a **defect-free array**. 
This repository provides just an implementation of (some of) the most-known atom-site matching algorithms in square arrays.
